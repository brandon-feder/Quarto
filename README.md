# Quarto
This is an AI for the boardgame Quarto. I will be comming out with a video about it soon.

The only thing I want to add is about the input and output files and there format.

The input file is play.in which first contains a number corresponding to the piece that is being given (-1 means that the bot should give a piece), then followed by 16 numbers coresponding to the board (-1 means empty spot).

The output file is verry similar with the first number being who won (-1 means opponent, 0 means draw, and 1 means bot), followed by the piece being given (-1 if no piece being given because board is won), followed by 16 pieces that correspond to the board (-1 meaning empy spot).
